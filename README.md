# Do Not Disturb Sync for Wear

This project was forked from [bluden's Do Not Disturb Sync](https://github.com/blunden/DoNotDisturbSync).

I wanted a way to control my watch's DND status from Tasker so I did this. It is definitely a bodge but if there is enough demand I can clean it up and publish it.
